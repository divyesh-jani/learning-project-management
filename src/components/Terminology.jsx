      <ul>
        <li>Escalate - Appropriate when project team or sponsor agrees that opportunity is outside the scope of project or that the proposed response would exceed project manager's authority</li>
        <li>Exploit - High-priority opportunities where organization wants to realize the opportunity. Seeks to capture the benefit associated with opportunity by ensuring it definitely happens.</li>
        <li>Share - Transferring ownership of opportunity to third party so it shares some of the benefit if opportunity occurs.</li>

      <p><strong>Prompt Lists</strong> - Predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk. Common strategic frameworks are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental)</li>
        <li>TECOP (technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political)</li>

      <p><strong>Scatter Diagrams</strong> - A graph that shows the relationship between two variables.</p>
      <p><strong>Schedule Compression</strong> - Techniques used to shorten or accelerate schedule duration without reducing project scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. These techniques include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crashing - Shorten duration by adding resources. Examples include approving overtime, adding resources. Crashing only works for activities on the critical path.</li>
        <li>Fast Tracking - Activities normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. Fast Tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten project duration on critical path.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Avoid - Level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside agreed-upon risk threshold</li>
        <li>Exploit - Level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk threshold</li>
        <li>Transfer/Share - Level of overall project risk is high but organization is unable to address it effectively, a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of organization</li>
        <li>Mitigate/Enhance - Changing the level of overall project risk to optimize the chances of achieving project's objectives. Mitigation strategy is used where overall project risk is negative, and enhancement applies when it is positive</li>
        <li>Accept - Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project risk, the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even if overall project risk is outside the agreed-upon threshold. Most common strategy is to establish an overall contingency reserve for the project.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Strategies for Threats</strong> - These are five alternative strategies that may be considered for dealing with threats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Escalate - Appropriate when project team or sponsor agrees that threat is outside the scope of project or that the proposed response would exceed project manager's authority</li>
        <li>Avoid - When project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact. This may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high probability of occurrence and a large negative impact.</li>
        <li>Transfer - Shift ownership of threat to third party to manage the risk and bear the impact if the threat occurs</li>
        <li>Mitigate - Action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat</li>
        <li>Accept - Acknowledges existence of a threat, but no proactive action is taken.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>SWOT Analysis</strong> - Analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an organization, project, or option.</p>
      <p><strong>Three-point Estimation</strong> - Using three-point estimate helps define an appropriate range and thus provides improved estimation compared to single-point duration estimates. The three points are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most Likely (tM) - Realistic expectations</li>
        <li>Optimistic (tO) - Best case scenario</li>
        <li>Pessimistic (tP) - Worst case scenario</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Triangular Distribution formula is tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3</p>
      <p><strong>Risk's Expected Monitory Value</strong>: Impact($) x Probability(%)</p>
