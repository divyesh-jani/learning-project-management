      <h3 className='text-center'>Project Management Domains</h3>
      <p>A project performance domain is a group of related activities that are critical for the effective delivery of project outcomes. There are 8 project performance domains:</p>

      <h4>1. Stakeholders</h4>
      <p><strong>Stakeholder</strong> is an individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project, program, or portfolio.</p>
      <p><strong>Stakeholder Analysis</strong> is a method of systematically gathering and analyzing quantitative and qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account throughout the project.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain11.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Stakeholder Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p>Stakeholder Engagement circle: Identify - Understand - Analyze - Prioritize - Engage - Monitor - Identify</p>
      <p><strong>Communications Methods:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Push - Used for one-way communication, such as memos, emails, status reports sent to stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Pull - Information sought by stakeholder, such as going on intranet to find policies, repository.</li>
        <li>Interactive communication or Engagement - This goes deeper that pull or push as it is interactive.</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>

      <h4>2. Team</h4>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain21.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Team Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p><strong>Servant leadership</strong> is a style that focuses on understanding and addressing the needs and development of project team members in order to enable the highest possible project team performance. Servant leadership behaviors include: Obstacle removal, Diversion shield, Encouragement and development opportunities.</p>
      <p>Motivation to perform can intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from inside the individual or is associated with the work. This is about finding pleasure in work rather than focusing on rewards. Extrinsic motivation is performing work because of some external reward such as bonus.</p>
      <p><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong> is the ability to recognize our own emotions and those of others. This information is used to guide thinking and behavior. Four key areas of emotional intelligence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-awareness - ability to conduct a realistic self-assessment (including own emotions, goals, motivations, strengths, weaknesses)</li>
        <li>Self-management - also called self-regulation, ability to control, and redirect disruptive feelings and impulses</li>
        <li>Social awareness - about empathy, understanding and considering other's feelings. Ability to read nonverbal cues and body language</li>
        <li>Social skill - concerned with managing groups of people, building social networks and rapport, finding common ground</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Self-awareness and self-management are required to remain calm and productive, social awareness and social skills allow for better bonds with team members and stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Decisions can be made unilaterally and has the advantage of being fast but is prone to error when compared to engaging the wisdom of a diverse set of people.</p>
      <p><strong>Conflict Management</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep communications open and respectful</li>
        <li>Focus on issues, not the people</li>
        <li>Focus on present and future, not the past</li>
        <li>Search for alternatives together</li>
      </ul>
      <figure className='figure'>

      </figure>

      <h4>3. Development Approach and Life Cycle</h4>
      <p><strong>Deliverable</strong> is any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.</p>
      <p><strong>Cadence</strong> is a rhythm of activities conducted throughout the project.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain31.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p>Delivery cadence refers to timing and frequency of project deliverables. Can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single delivery</li>
        <li>Multiple deliveries</li>
        <li>Periodic deliveries - like multiple deliveries but on fixed delivery schedule such as every 2 weeks or monthly</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Continuous delivery</strong> is the practice of delivering feature increments immediately to customers, often through the use of small batches of work and automation technology. This is be best used for digital products.</p>
      <p>Development approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Predictive (Waterfall) - requirements can be defined and analyzed at the start of the project</li>
        <li>Adaptive (Agile) - requirements are subject to high level of uncertainty and likely to change</li>
        <li>Hybrid - combination of predictive and adaptive</li>
      </ul>
      <figure className='figure'>

      <h4>4. Planning</h4>
      <p><strong>Accuracy</strong> is an assessment of correctness.</p>
      <p><strong>Precision</strong> is an assessment of exactness.</p>
      <p><strong>Crashing</strong> is a method used to shorten schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.</p>
      <p><strong>Fast Tracking</strong> is a schedule compression method in which activities normally done in sequence are performed in parallel.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain41.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Planning Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p>It is becoming more common for initial planning to consider social and environmental impacts in addition to financial impacts (referred to as triple bottom line).</p>
      <p>Information gained from planning should be sufficient to move forward in an appropriate manner but not more detailed than necessary. It is inefficient to spend more time planning than is needed.</p>
      <p><strong>Presenting and Adjusting Estimates</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deterministic and Probabilistic estimating - Deterministic estimates, also known as point estimates, present a single number or amount. Probabilistic estimates include a range of estimates with associated probabilities within the range.</li>
        <li>Absolute and Relative estimating - Absolute estimates are specific numbers and relative estimates are shown in comparison to other estimates. One form of relative estimating is planning poker.</li>
        <li>Flow-based estimating - developed by determining cycle time and throughput. Cycle time is total time it takes one unit to get through a process. Throughput is number of items that can complete a process in given amount of time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Schedule</strong> is a model for executing project's activities, including durations, dependencies, and other planning information.</p>
      <p><strong>Lead</strong> is where the work of successor activity is accelerated, such as starting a successor activity before predecessor has finished. Lag is delay of successor activity.</p>
      <p>Project budget should include contingency reserve funds to allow for uncertainty or risk. Management reserves are set aside for unexpected activities related to in-scope work.</p>

      <h4>5. Project Work</h4>
      <p><strong>Bid Documents</strong> are all documents used to solicit information, quotations, or proposals from prospective sellers.</p>
      <p><strong>Explicit Knowledge</strong> can be codified using symbols such as words, numbers, and pictures.</p>
      <p><strong>Tacit Knowledge</strong> is personal knowledge that can be difficult to articulate such as experience, beliefs, and insights.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain51.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Project Work Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p><strong>Request for Information</strong> is used to gather more information from the market prior to sending out bid documents to a set of selected vendors.</p>
      <p><strong>Request for Proposal</strong> is used for complex or complicated scope where the buyer is looking for vendor to provide a solution.</p>
      <p><strong>Request for Quote</strong> is used when price is the main deciding factor, and the proposed solution is readily available.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>

      <h4>6. Delivery</h4>
      <p><strong>Requirement</strong> is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy a business need.</p>
      <p><strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong> is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by team to accomplish project objectives and create required deliverables.</p>
      <p><strong>Definition of Done (DoD)</strong> is a checklist of all criteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready for customer use.</p>
      <p><strong>Cost of Quality (COQ)</strong> are all costs incurred over the life of product by investing in preventing nonconformance to requirements, appraisal of product or service for conformance to requirements, and failure to meet requirements.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain61.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Delivery Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p>Business value often continues to be captured long after the initial project has ended. A business case document often provides business justification and a projection of anticipated business value from a project.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>

      <h4>7. Measurement</h4>
      <p><strong>Metric</strong> is a description of a project or product attribute and how to measure it.</p>
      <p><strong>Baseline</strong> is approved version of work product used as a basis for comparison to actual results.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain71.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Measurement Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p><strong>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</strong> are quantifiable measures used to evaluate success of a project. Types of KPIs are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leading Indicators - these can predict changes or trends in a project</li>
        <li>Lagging Indicators - these measure project deliverables or events</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lagging indicators can also be used to find correlations between outcomes and environment variables.</p>
      <p>Characteristics of Effective Metrics (SMART):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Specific</li>
        <li>Meaningful</li>
        <li>Achievable</li>
        <li>Relevant</li>
        <li>Timely</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Lead Time</strong> is a measure that indicates the amount of elapsed time from a story or chuck of work entering the backlog to the end of iteration or release. Lower lead time indicates a more effective process and a more productive team.</p>
      <p><strong>Cycle Time</strong> indicates the amount of time it takes the project team to complete a task. Shorter time indicates a more productive team. A consistent time helps predict the possible rate of work in the future.</p>
      <p><strong>Batch Size</strong> is the estimated amount of work that is expected to be completed in an iteration.</p>
      <p><strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</strong> measures the degree to which a stakeholder is willing to recommend a product or service to others. Ranges from -100 to +100. This not only measures satisfaction with a brand, product, or service, but is also an indicator of customer loyalty.</p>
      <p><strong>Throughput Analysis</strong> is a method that assesses the number of items being completed in a fixed time frame.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Radiators</strong> (also known as <strong>Big Visible Charts - BVCs</strong>) are physical displays that provide information to the rest of the organization, enabling timely knowledge sharing.  They are posted in a place where people can see the information easily. These should be easy to update, and should be updated frequently.</p>
      <p><strong>Hawthorne Effect</strong> states that the very act of measuring something influences behavior.</p>
      <p><strong>Vanity Metric</strong> is a measure that shows data but does not provide useful information for making decisions.</p>

      </figure>

      <h4>8. Uncertainty</h4>
      <p><strong>Uncertainty</strong> is a lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue.</p>
      <p><strong>Ambiguity</strong> is a state of being unclear.</p>
      <p><strong>Volatility</strong> is the possibility for rapid or unpredictable change.</p>
      <p><strong>Risk</strong> is uncertain event or condition that, if occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.</p>
      <figure className='figure'>
        <img src='/assets/domains/domain81.png' className='figure-img img-fluid rounded' alt='Uncertainty Performance Domain' />
      </figure>
      <p>Responding to Uncertainty:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gather information</li>
        <li>Prepare for multiple outcomes</li>
        <li>Set-based design</li>
        <li>Build in resilience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Responding to Ambiguity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Progressive elaboration</li>
        <li>Experiments</li>
        <li>Prototypes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Negative risks are called threats and positive risks are called opportunities. Overall project risk is the effect or uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Strategies to deal with Threats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid (eliminate threat)</li>
        <li>Escalate (outside scope of project and exceeds project manager's authority)</li>
        <li>Transfer (shifting ownership of threat to third party to manage risk and bear the impact)</li>
        <li>Mitigate (reduce probability of occurrence and/or impact of threat)</li>
        <li>Accept (no proactive action is taken)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A response to a specific threat might include multiple strategies. The goal of implementing threat responses is to reduce the amount of negative risk.</p>
      <p>Strategies to deal with Opportunities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exploit (ensure opportunity occurs)</li>
        <li>Escalate (outside scope of project and exceeds project manager's authority)</li>
        <li>Share (allocate ownership to third party who is best able to capture the benefit)</li>
        <li>Enhance (increase the probability of occurrence and/or impact of opportunity)</li>
        <li>Accept (no proactive action is taken)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reserve is an amount of time or budget set aside to account for handling risks. Contingency reserve is set aside to address identified risks should they occur. Management reserve is a budget used for unknown event such as unplanned, in-scope work.</p>
